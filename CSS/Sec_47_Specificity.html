    if one Element ims styled by more than one rule, which style will be applicable

    Answer
    More specific rule will get more value

    General Rule
    1.!important will override every thing
    2.Inline can override everything except !important
    3.External will work according to specificity

    Specificity Rule
    1â€¢(#) Id selector has highest value
    2.(*) Universal selector has lowest value

    Specificity Rule Trick (Paint System)
    .10,000 point to !important
    .1000 to inline
    .100 to id
    .10 to class, attribute or pseudo-class
    .1 for element selector & pseudo-elements
    .O to universal selector

    1point p{
    Color: green;
    }

    10 point .red-p{
    Color: red;
    }

    11 point div.red-p{
    Color: blue;
    }

    div.red-p{
    Color: yellow; <!-- it will overwrite -->
    }

    Note: if same rule written two or more times in external sheet then last rule will be applicable.
